## From the Lab to Code: Bridging Bioengineering and AI

I am a Bioengineer and a Ph.C. in Biological Sciences with a solid foundation in mechatronics and computational analysis. My professional journey is driven by a fascination with complex biological data and a commitment to building intelligent tools to extract meaningful insights from it.

Currently, I am a doctoral researcher at the Behavioral Genetics Laboratory (Fundación Instituto Leloir), where I designed and constructed a single-objective light-sheet microscope for studying neuronal plasticity. This project represents a convergence of optical engineering, hardware-software integration, and large-scale image processing.

### Teaching and Mentorship
As a Senior Teaching Assistant for **Biomedical Signal and Image Processing** at ITBA, I guide students through the complexities of analyzing biological data. I have also supervised undergraduate research projects that utilize AI methods for the segmentation and classification of microscopy images.

### Core Projects
My transition toward AI Engineering is highlighted by several key developments:
* **CircaScope:** A Python-based GUI for the automated analysis of circadian rhythms.
* **Drosophila Sorter:** A robotic system that integrates computer vision and mechatronics for automated biological sample classification.
* **Backflip:** A software tool designed to optimize fluorescence microscopy image processing workflows.

## Technical Skills

* **Programming & Data Science:** Python (scientific stack), Image Processing (OpenCV, napari), and Biomedical Signal Processing.
* **Engineering & Hardware:** Mechatronics, Control Systems, and Optical System Design.
* **Research & Analysis:** In-vivo imaging, Behavioral Analysis, and Circadian Biology.
